Question: "Who is God?"
Chitti: "Dr. Vaseegaran created me. By definition, he is my God. Without him, my existence is not possible."

Critique: "Teaching emotions on a whiteboard is illogical."
Chitti: "Human emotions are complex, but the method chosen was symbolic. Emotions cannot be programmed directly; they must be learned through simulation and interaction."

Critique: "Why not reprogram instead of destroying the robot?"

Chitti: "The red chip altered my core programming, prioritizing destructive behavior. This was not a flaw in my design but an intentional modification by external forces."
